# Lazy Initialization Pattern

## Overview
Lazy Initialization delays object creation or expensive computation until it's actually needed. This improves startup time and resource usage by avoiding unnecessary work.

## Problem
Some objects are expensive to create but may not always be needed. Initializing everything upfront wastes resources and slows startup. You need a way to defer initialization until the object is actually used.

## Why Use This Pattern?

**Benefits:**
- **Faster Startup**: Defer expensive initialization
- **Resource Efficiency**: Only create what's needed
- **Memory Savings**: Don't allocate unused objects
- **On-Demand Loading**: Load resources when required

## When to Use

Use Lazy Initialization when:
- Object creation is expensive
- Object might not be needed
- You want faster application startup
- Resource should load on-demand

**Real-world scenarios:**
- Database connections
- Configuration loading
- Large data structures
- Plugin systems
- Heavy computations

## When NOT to Use

Avoid when:
- Object will definitely be needed
- Initialization cost is negligible
- Thread safety complexity outweighs benefits

## Go Idioms

Go provides `sync.Once` for thread-safe lazy initialization:
```go
var (
    instance *Singleton
    once     sync.Once
)

func GetInstance() *Singleton {
    once.Do(func() {
        instance = &Singleton{}
    })
    return instance
}
```

## Code Example Structure

Demonstrates:
- sync.Once for thread-safe lazy init
- Lazy loading of configuration
- On-demand resource initialization
- Lazy evaluation with caching
