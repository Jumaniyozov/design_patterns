# Template Method Pattern
## Overview
Defines skeleton of algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses. In Go, achieved through composition.

## When to Use
- Algorithm with invariant parts
- Code reuse across similar algorithms
- Hook methods for customization

## Benefits
✓ Code reuse
✓ Controlled extension points
✓ Inversion of control
