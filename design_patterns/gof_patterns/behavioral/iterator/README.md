# Iterator Pattern
## Overview
Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## When to Use
- Collection traversal
- Multiple traversal algorithms
- Hide collection complexity

## Benefits
✓ Uniform interface for traversal
✓ Multiple iterators simultaneously
✓ Encapsulation of collection
