# Bridge Pattern
## Overview
Separates abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.

## When to Use
- Avoid permanent binding between abstraction and implementation
- Both abstraction and implementation should be extensible
- Platform independence

## Benefits
✓ Decouples interface from implementation
✓ Improves extensibility
✓ Hides implementation details
