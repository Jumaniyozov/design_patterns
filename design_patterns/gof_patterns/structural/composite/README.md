# Composite Pattern

## Overview
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Problem  
File systems, UI components, organizational charts need to treat single items and groups uniformly.

## When to Use
- Tree structures (files/folders, UI hierarchies)
- Part-whole relationships  
- Recursive structures

## Key Advantages
✓ Treat primitives and composites uniformly
✓ Easy to add new components
✓ Simplifies client code
